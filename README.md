# DestroyDog

## About

DestroyDog is a javascript bookmarklet for destroying websites. When launched, it aggressively deletes every element on the page until only it remains. Good for dealing with unhelpful forum threads or unskippable YouTube ads.

## How to use

1. Create a new bookmark in your web browser.
2. In the URL section, paste the text from **DestroyDog.js**.
3. Click the bookmark whenever a website gets on your nerves.
